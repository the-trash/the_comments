### :books: &nbsp; [Documentation](docs/documentation.md)

## If you have any questions

Please try playing around with the **[Dummy App](spec/dummy_app)** in the `spec` folder first. An example integration is often better than any documentation! Thanks.

## How to start the dummy app (screencast)

[![Foo](https://raw.github.com/the-teacher/the_comments/master/docs/screencast.jpg)](http://vk.com/video_ext.php?oid=49225742&id=166578209&hash=10be1dba625149bb&hd=3)

## Quick Start Installation

**NB: In the following examples, `Posts` is the model to which comments are being added. For your app, the model might be `Articles` or similar instead.**

### 1. Install Gems

**Gemfile**

```ruby
gem "the_comments", "~> 2.2.1"

gem 'haml'                # or gem 'slim'
gem 'awesome_nested_set'  # or same gem
```

**Bundle**

```
bundle
```

Don't forget to restart your server!

```
rake the_comments_engine:install:migrations

      t.integer :my_published_comments_count,  default: 0
      t.integer :my_comments_count,            default: 0 # my_draft_comments_count + my_published_comments_count

      # commentable's comments => comcoms (cache counters)
      # Relation through Comment#holder_id field

### 4. Models modifictions

**app/models/user.rb**

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  include TheComments::User

  has_many :posts

  # IT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE OF ANY ROLE SYSTEM
  def admin?
    self == User.first
  end

  # YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT YOUR ROLE POLICY FOR COMMENTS HERE
  def comments_admin?
    admin?
  end

  def comments_moderator? comment
    id == comment.holder_id
  end
end
```

**app/models/post.rb**

```ruby
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  include TheComments::Commentable

  belongs_to :user

  # Denormalization methods
  # Check the documentation for information on advanced usage
  def commentable_title
    "Undefined Post Title"
  end

  def commentable_url
    "#"
  end

  def commentable_state
    "published"
  end
end
```

### 5. Add routes

**config/routes.rb**

```ruby
MyApp::Application.routes.draw do
  root 'posts#index'
  resources :posts

  # ...

  # TheComments routes
  concern   :user_comments,  TheComments::UserRoutes.new
  concern   :admin_comments, TheComments::AdminRoutes.new
  resources :comments, concerns:  [:user_comments, :admin_comments]
end
```

Refer to the [documentation](docs/documentation.md) for more information

### 6. Add to Application Controller

**app/controllers/application_controller.rb**

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  include TheComments::ViewToken

  # Prevent CSRF attacks by raising an exception.
  # For APIs, you may want to use :null_session instead.
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
end
```

### 7. Install assets

**app/assets/stylesheets/application.css**

```css
/*
 *= require the_comments
*/
```

**app/assets/javascripts/application.js**

```js
//= require the_comments
```

### 8. Example controller code

**app/controllers/posts_controller.rb**

```ruby
def show
  @post     = Post.find params[:id]
  @comments = @post.comments.with_state([:draft, :published])
end
```

### 9. Example view code

**app/views/posts/show.html.haml**

```haml
= render partial: 'the_comments/tree', locals: { commentable: @post, comments_tree: @comments }
```

### Common problems

For error with `unpermitted parameters` in webserver output.

Example:

    Unpermitted parameters: commentable_type, commentable_id

    User Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "users".* FROM "users"  WHERE "users"."id" = 1  ORDER BY "users"."id" ASC LIMIT 1

    Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 8ms

Add the following to your Comments Controller.

    def comment_params
      params
      .require(:comment)
      .permit(:title, :contacts, :raw_content, :parent_id, :commentable_type, :commentable_id)
      .merge(denormalized_fields)
      .merge(request_data_for_comment)
      .merge(tolerance_time: params[:tolerance_time].to_i)
      .merge(user: current_user, view_token: comments_view_token)
    end
